Welcome to Neighborly!

Neighborly is a service that encourages socializing amongst your neighbors.
What better way to get to know your neighbors, than to help one another out?

With Neighborly, you can ask your neighbors for help and offer your help to others.
Your services should be provided free of charge!  The goal here is NOT to make money,
but rather to simply get to know your neighbors!  Who knows, the reward could be better
than financial compensation if you make a new friend, or perhaps find a new babysitter.

To get started, simply post a request on the home page and/or accept a request that has already
been posted.

We hope that this service brings together people and strengthens communities!
